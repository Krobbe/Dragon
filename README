Very welcome to Project Dragon!

To start the game, follow these steps:

1. Make sure that you have Java Version 1.6.0 installed on your computer. 
2. Find server.main.Main and run to start server (has to be done on one computer only)
3. Find client.main.Main and run to start client (has to be done on every computer that wants to play game)

Good Luck!
