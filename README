Very welcome to Project Dragon!

Observe! The project is developed and tested in Java Version 1.6.0_31.

To start a game, follow these steps after importing the project into eclipse:

Setting up the server
1. Find server.main.Main and run to start the server
2 Input the port number to open the RMI-registry (Be sure that the port is open, unsued and useable over your local network.)
	or
2 Press "enter" without an entry to use the default port (1099)

Setting up a client
1 Find client.main.Main and run to start client
2.1 Input existing account's username and password
	or if existing account's are unknown
2.1 Click the register button and input name, password etc.
	2.2 Input the newly created account's username and password
3.1 Enter the IP-adress (the digits can be found printed in the server's console) and port number to the server
	or
3.1 Leave the text fields blank to use either the default IP (localhost), the default port (1099) or both


Good Luck!
