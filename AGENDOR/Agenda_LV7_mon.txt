Time: 15:16
Facilitator: Robin Andersson
Participants: Lisa Stenberg, Mattias Henriksson, Mathias Forssén
	1.	Objectives (5 min)
		The drilling is really annoying! 
		Server and client is causing some issues. We are debating what the best implementation is.
		Need to add a button or something similar to the table view to handle "I'm not ready to play yet". 
	2.	Reports (15 min)
		Lisa has implemented lots of database functionality.
		Mathias has been working on the GUI and Events. 
		Mattias has been working with the Events and added a P class for easier access to certain variables.
		Robin broke the server, then he fixed it again. More work has been done on the server.
	3.	Discussion items (35 min)
	
	4.	Outcomes and assignments (5 min)
		We have decided that our game will only use the "tournament" rules. We will not let new players join a table once the game has started. The application should still be easily modified to also allow players to join a game in progress.

		We can have smaller Events, like showCard rather than showFlop.

		We need to sit down together and code, easier to sove problems.

		When a check, bet etc is made the event published should contain a Bet.

	5. 	Wrap up
